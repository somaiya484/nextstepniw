        question: 'ðŸ“Œ 1. What is the EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver)?',
        answer: `The EB-2 NIW is a U.S. green card category that allows individuals with an advanced degree or exceptional ability to self-petition for permanent residency without employer sponsorship.
To qualify, you must:
- Hold a Masterâ€™s degree (or higher) or demonstrate exceptional ability.
- Propose a professional endeavor that has substantial merit and national importance.
- Prove you are well-positioned to advance that endeavor.
- Show that waiving the labor certification process would benefit the U.S.`
    },
    {
        question: 'ðŸ“Œ 2. What is the EB-1A (Extraordinary Ability) category?',
        answer: `The EB-1A is for individuals who have achieved sustained national or international acclaim in their field. It allows you to self-petition without a job offer. You must meet at least 3 out of 10 USCIS criteria such as:
- Receiving prestigious awards
- Publishing original research
- Making significant contributions in your field
- Holding a critical role in distinguished organizations
- Membership in selective professional associations`
    },
    {
        question: 'ðŸ“Œ 3. Can I apply for a green card without an employer?',
        answer: `Yes. Both EB-2 NIW and EB-1A are self-petition categories, meaning no employer sponsorship or job offer is required. Ideal for independent researchers, entrepreneurs, freelancers, and consultants.`
    },
    {
        question: 'ðŸ“Œ 4. What services do you offer?',
        answer: `âœ… Full Petition Preparation Package â€“ We handle everything: drafting, evidence organization, recommendation letters, RFE response, and post-approval support.
âœ… Custom/Targeted Services â€“ For clients needing help with specific parts like:

    },
    {
        question: 'ðŸ“Œ 6. How long does the petition process take?',
        answer: `Full petition prep takes 3â€“6 weeks depending on document availability and communication speed. After submission, USCIS times vary (6â€“12 months for NIW, faster for EB-1A with Premium Processing). RFE support is included in full packages.`
    },
    {
        question: 'ðŸ“Œ 7. What happens if I receive a Request for Evidence (RFE)?',
